# datamining_project
In this project I have implemented Naive Bayes Classifier for predicting the ratings of the given reviews. We are given a dataset called BoardGameGeek, it is the worldâ€™s largest board game site, it contains all the comments and reviews by the users of all the board games. Firstly, I have done the Preprocessing part as it is one of the most important sections while developing any data mining model. Secondly, I have used scikit-learn's Multinomial Naive Bayes. I have used various preprocessing methods such as removing stop words, countvectorizer for cleaning the dataset and making it more easy to use.
